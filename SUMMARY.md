## 🛠️ How to run:

1.  Open terminal in the project folder.
2.  Start development server:
    ```bash

## 🧪 Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all unit tests for the components.

## 📝 What to customize:

*   **Photo**: Replace `public/profile.jpg` with your photo.
*   **Resume**: Place your PDF file as `public/resume.pdf`.
*   **Content**: Edit files in `src/sections/` (especially `Hero.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `Projects.jsx`) to add your real data.

Enjoy using it!
